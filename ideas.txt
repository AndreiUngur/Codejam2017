- minutes played + aggressiveness VERSUS injury rate?

- Input : teams/players you want, get back an "ultimate team" which fits what you want

------------------------------------------------------------
- take in stats like FG %, etc. then determine: What's the probability that a play works?

- ----------------------------------------------------------

IDEA:
  -> User decides which players he wants and where he wants them on the court

  -> System weighs years (so newer "stats" are worth more)
  
MVP:

- UI
  -> Field
  -> Search bar with player names
  -> Collect info about the player from some sports API and return basic info (headshot, basic info)
  -> Drag & Drop capability with heads
  -> Send which "zone" the player is in

- Data handling
  -> MVP : Get zone info and return that player's data for that specific zone
